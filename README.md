# Place Syncer
A utility tool that combines two Roblox places into one.

This tool supports both file paths and place IDs! Providing place.rbxlx is the same as the place with the ID 1233, these work the same:

`lune run Sync place.rbxlx 1234 Output`

and

`lune run Sync 1233 1234 Output`

## Instructions
1. If you haven't already, [install](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/getting-started/1-installation) the [Lune runtime](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) before reading the next steps.
2. Open the Place-Syncer folder in a terminal of your choice.
3. Have fun!
4. [OPTIONAL] You can extract the Module, Maps and Remodel files for your own personal use!
