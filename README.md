# Place Syncer
A utility tool that combines two Roblox places into one.

This tool supports both file paths and place IDs! As long as place.rbxlx is the same as the place with the ID 1233, `lune run Sync place.rbxlx 1234 Output` and `lune run Sync 1233 1234 Output` work the same!

## Instructions
1. If you haven't already, [install](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/getting-started/1-installation) the [Lune runtime](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) before reading the next steps.
2. Create a folder named "Files" in the same directory as Module.luau.
3. Open the Place-Syncer folder in a terminal of your choice.
4. Have fun!
5. [OPTIONAL] You can extract the Module, Maps and Remodel files for your own personal use!
